A keyboard transcript controller for UMich Lecture Recordings [(link)](https://leccap.engin.umich.edu/leccap).

This extension lets you go through transcript lines using the keyboard instead of the mouse. It also synchronizes captions with transcript lines to eliminate display lag.

Keyboard navigation is especially beneficial since some transcript lines span one line while others take up two. Mouse clicks can easily miss the intended target when the line height changes, but the keyboard provides precise (and geek!) control.

## Default Keybindings

- `<` — Move to the previous transcript line
- `>` — Move to the next transcript line

> **Note:** Ensure the transcript tab is enabled for the extension to work correctly.

## Features

- **Keyboard Navigation:** Quickly and accurately move through transcript lines without the risk of misclicks due to varying line heights.
- **Synchronized Captions:** Instantly updates captions to match the current transcript line, eliminating the original lag on the website.
